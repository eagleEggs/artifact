# relyx

### What is it?

A personal experiment.

- A tool to track anything and pipe it into a SQL database
- Once it's there, graphs are generated
- Backend correllations are performed automatically - Giving insight into cause and effect across small details of your life

The point of the functionality is to visualize the effects of the small things you do, that you never see.
